The default mode is trace mode which means the current Lorenz Attractor will be traced by a line.
To change the mode to draw mode where the entire Lorenz Attractor is drawn at once, press m.

To rotate around the X and Y axes use the arrow keys.

To increase the value of the b parameter to the Lorenz Attractor press shift-b (B), to decrease just press b.
To increase the value of the s parameter to the Lorenz Attractor press shift-s (B), to decrease just press s.
To increase the value of the r parameter to the Lorenz Attractor press shift-r (R), to decrease just press r.
