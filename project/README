Other things to note
---------------------
1. When running into objects or end of scene the helicopter blows up.
2. There are no normals or collision detection for hills.

Future Work
--------------
1. Shoot orbs out of helicopter and blow up objects. (likely)
2. Have trees and buildings at correct elevations. (not likely)
3. Get normals correct for hills. (not likely)
4. Implement perlin noise for terrain. (not likely)

**** Question ****
------------
How can I speed up the frame rate?  By decreasing the size of the scene?
The size of the scene made it so I couldn't have shadows because it slowed
everything down too much.
