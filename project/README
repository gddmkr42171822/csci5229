  Known Bug
  ---------
  I could not figure out how to get the image of the cockpit to not be distorted on the sphere.  
  I tried to make my own UV mapped image of the cockpit with a single side view of a real little bird cockpit but it obviously didn't work out.
  Do you have any suggestion for the future to make this looks better?
