Other things to note
---------------------
1. When running into objects or end of scene the helicopter blows up.
2. There are no normals or collision detection for hills.

Future Work
--------------
1. Shoot orbs out of helicopter and blow up objects. (likely)
2. Have trees and buildings at correct elevations. (not likely)
3. Get normals correct for hills. (not likely)
4. Implement perlin noise for terrain. (not likely)

What I looked at or tried to implement
---------------------------------------
1. Billboarding to increase framerate (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
2. Perlin noise to generate terrain (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
3. Shadows (unsuccessful due to framerate)
4. Normals for hills (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
5. Trees and buildings at correct elevations (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
